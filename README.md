# Distance-Evaluator
Java applet progam that evaluate the distance traveled at regular intervals of time, given the values of the initial velocity and the acceleration.
## The problem
The total distance travelled by a vehicle in t seconds is given by 
	Distance = ut + (at<sup>2</sup>)/2
Where u is the initial velocity (m/s), a is the acceleration (m/s<sup>2</sup>).
Write a java applet program to evaluate the distance traveled at regular intervals of time, given the values of u and a. The input and output should be on an option pane.
## The solution
